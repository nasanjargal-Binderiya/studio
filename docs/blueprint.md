# **App Name**: LeetReview

## Core Features:

- Metadata Parsing: Parse the LeetCode problem metadata (title, URL, difficulty, date solved, review rating) from user input. The input should be a block of text that is copy-pasted into the app.
- Review Scheduling: Schedule reminders to review LeetCode problems based on their rating (1-5), with each rating corresponding to a different number of days until the next review. Store the scheduled review dates.
- Review List: Display a list of LeetCode problems due for review, sorted by review date.  Each item should include the problem title, URL, difficulty, and a button to mark as reviewed.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#24292F) for a focused and professional feel.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#F6F8FA) for backgrounds and subtle accents.
- Accent: Teal (#28A745) to indicate progress, success, and important actions.
- Clean and modern sans-serif fonts for code snippets and problem descriptions.
- Clear separation of input area, review list, and individual problem details.
- Use recognizable icons for LeetCode problem difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).
